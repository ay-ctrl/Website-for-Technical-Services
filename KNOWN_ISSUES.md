## Known Issues & Areas for Improvement

This project is functional and serves its core purposes, but several improvements are noted here to enhance security, user experience, and backend robustness. 

### 🔒 Security & Validation Issues

- **Lack of Input Length Validation**  
  Some input fields do not enforce minimum/maximum length constraints, which could lead to malformed data.

- **Request ID Format**  
  The current request ID is short (5 digits), predictable, and potentially non-unique. A UUID or timestamp-based format is recommended.

- **No Rate Limiting**  
  Users can send unlimited requests in a short time. Throttling mechanisms like rate limiting middleware should be introduced.

- **Missing Cache Control Headers**  
  Static and dynamic resources lack proper caching directives, which may lead to outdated or insecure content being reused.

- **Invalid File Input Handling**  
  The system does not always respond correctly when invalid file types are submitted — unexpected behavior or crashes may occur.

### 🗄️ Database & File Upload Issues

- **No File Size Limit**  
  There is currently no restriction on the maximum size of uploaded files, which may cause performance or storage issues.

- **Weak File Type Validation**  
  MIME type or file extension checks are either missing or too loose, which may lead to unsafe file uploads.

- **Unclear Upload Field Requirements**  
  When a user attempts to upload a file without providing a caption or only submits partial data, the system may fail silently without warning or error messages.

- **Google Drive Management is Manual**
  The Google Drive token is obtained manually. After deployment to production, when the token expires, the application cannot refresh it programmatically, and file uploading stops working.

These issues do not prevent the application from running in a development setting but should be addressed before production deployment.
