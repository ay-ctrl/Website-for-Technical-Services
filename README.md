## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ay-ctrl/Website-for-Technical-Services
cd Website-for-Technical-Services
````

### 2. Install Dependencies
````bash
npm install
````

### 3. Create a .env File

Fill .env file with your Google API project credentials and MongoDB connection URI.

### 3.1 How to Get Google OAuth2 Credentials

Go to Google Cloud Console

Create a new project or select an existing one

Navigate to API & Services > Credentials

Click "Create Credentials" > OAuth 2.0 Client ID

Set the Authorized Redirect URI to: http://localhost:5000

After creation, copy the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET into your .env file.

Download the credentials.json and place it in your root project directory.

### 4. Get Your Google Drive Token

To access the Google Drive API, you must generate an access token.

Step 1: Run authDrive.js
````bash
node authDrive.js
````
This will open a Google login page in your browser.

Step 2: Copy the code from the URL
After logging in, you will be redirected to a URL like this:

http://localhost:3000/?code=XYZ123abc
Copy the value after code=.

Step 3: Paste the Code in Terminal
When prompted in the terminal with: "Enter the code from that page here:"
Paste the copied code and press Enter.

If successful, a file named token.json will be automatically created in your project root. This file stores the token required to access the Google Drive API.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the Application
````bash
npm start
````

‚ùó Notes

If your token expires or is deleted, re-run authDrive.js to generate a new one.

Do not commit .env, credentials.json, or token.json to version control.

These files are excluded via .gitignore for security.
